Twin design pattern represents pattern that can be used to simulate multiple inheritance.

_Since Twin design pattern is not often used and can be slightly confusing, 
here is additional explanation of example code that is provided:_

````
In this example Versionable interface represents additional functionality (besides DocumentOperation ones).

Twin classes here are:
    - TextDocument and VersionableTextDocument
    - ExcelDocument and VersionableExcelDocument

VersionableTextDocument and VersionableExcelDocument classes both extend their respective parents (TextDocument and ExcelDocument)
and additionally implement the Versionable interface.
This approach provides the illusion of achieving multiple inheritance, as these classes inherit both behavior from their parent classes and enhanced functionality through the interface.
