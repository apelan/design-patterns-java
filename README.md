<h2> Design patterns</h2>

<h3>What are design patterns?</h3>
We often see occurring problems in software development and there is always a question how to solve them in elegant way?
This is where design patterns come in handy.

Design patterns helps us achieve reusable and maintainable software solutions 
by providing templates for solving commonly occurring problems.

Design patterns are grouped in three categories:
- [Creational](https://github.com/apelan/design-patterns-java/blob/master/src/creational/README-creational.md)
- [Structural](https://github.com/apelan/design-patterns-java/blob/master/src/structural/README-structural.md)
- [Behavioral](https://github.com/apelan/design-patterns-java/blob/master/src/behavioral/README-behavioral.md)

<h3>What can I see here?</h3>
Even though the goal was to have "real" examples (something that you can see in real project) I failed.
Some examples are something that I actually used/implemented/saw in real projects, 
some of them are created inspired from other sources 
but few of them are actually made-up examples just to understand how pattern works.

<h3>Why does this repository exist?</h3>
This repository is created as practice and for learning purposes.
Main idea behind this is to get familiar with design patterns and have example for each one of them at one place.

I definitely learned something working on this repository, hopefully others looking at it will as well.

<h3>Future of repository</h3>
Repository was private until recently, I decided to share it just in case someone else find it useful.

There have been some plans to improve the repository, but they will remain just a dream for now.
- Better description and class diagram
- Tests to prove them working properly
- More examples

<h3>You see any issues in repository?</h3>
Maybe I didn't understand something, made a mistake or miss something?
If you, looking at this code, find any issues please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to learn more and
have better examples!
